# CI/CD Pipeline Hyphen Alias

<!-- MY-AI-DEV-SYSTEM-EXPANSION-2026-05-05 -->

## Mission
This file is part of the expanded my-ai-dev-system structure inside the Product-Engineering OS. It exists to turn repository knowledge into production-ready assets, not isolated snippets. The artifact augments previous architecture and must not reduce, delete, or contradict existing generated content.

## Analysis
Analyzing all repository sources for CI/CD Pipeline Hyphen Alias patterns...

Sources reviewed include the current OS files, AGENTS.md, AI_EXECUTION_PROMPTS.md, CLAUDE.md, LOCAL_EXECUTION_MODE.md, governance/*, continue/rules, cursor/rules, GitHub workflow guidance, Source/Changelogs, Source/Codinglessonslearnt, prompt metadata schemas, Next/shadcn/React/Tailwind prompt packs, UI/UX master prompts, and design master rules.

Extracted repository principles:
- Treat clear user requests as execution instructions and avoid repeated permission loops unless the action is destructive, external, production-affecting, security-sensitive, or genuinely ambiguous.
- Preserve already working behavior. Prefer the smallest regression-risk solution and re-check affected flows after every change.
- Use append-only knowledge management for changelogs, coding lessons, build logs, governance notes, and architectural decisions.
- Mine changelogs and coding lessons before work. Explicitly avoid repeated traps: interface/schema drift, Supabase FK typing surprises, auth/session misuse, middleware redirect traps, RLS cross-table joins, provider param errors, concurrency/rate-limit omissions, and overly strict filters that erase valid results.
- For UI and frontend work, enforce Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Radix-compatible primitives, semantic tokens, Headline/CTA/Grid hierarchy, visible focus states, mobile/desktop validation, readable dropdowns, complete loading/empty/error/success states, and no overflow.
- For Next 15 / React 19 work, prefer App Router, Server Components by default, Client Components only for interactivity, explicit TypeScript props, route loading/error boundaries, Suspense when appropriate, minimal dependencies, and 
px shadcn@latest add.
- For prompt packages, require metadata validation, unique slugs, no hidden prompt-package files, no unsupported nested prompt structures, and .md, .mdc, or iprompt.json only when following the source prompt catalog rules.

## Operating Rules
- Read i_dev_system.md, SYSTEM.md, docs/repository_source_inventory.md, and the local domain instruction before execution.
- Before executing this, ensure scripts/ci-cd-pipeline.md; qa-and-checks/checklist.md is reviewed for compatibility.
- Do not erase prior decisions. If a new rule supersedes an older one, append a migration note and compatibility rationale.
- Keep business intent visible: define user problem, expected behavior, scope, non-goals, validation, and rollout impact.
- Include at least happy path, empty state, error state, permission failure, timeout/retry behavior, and rollback or recovery handling.
- When user-facing, provide React props, keyboard behavior, ARIA labels, responsive breakpoints, focus states, and loading/empty/error/success copy.
- When server-facing, provide API envelope, error taxonomy, idempotency, logging, redaction, rate limits, timeout caps, and observability fields.
- When data-facing, provide schema invariants, FK/index rules, migration/backfill strategy, rollback strategy, seed-data behavior, and query performance checks.

## Lossless Consolidation Import From `AI_PROMPTING_FOLDERSTRUCTURE/scripts/ci_cd_pipeline.md`

This section preserves unique and potentially unique source content during the 2026-05-08 folder-by-folder consolidation pass. It was imported append-only so no instruction, edge case, example, table row, code block, warning, implementation note, or nuance is lost. Exact duplication can be removed only after a section-by-section proof confirms no unique meaning remains.

# CI/CD Pipeline

## Purpose
This guide defines production-grade rules for build validation, test gates, deploy stages, rollback hooks, and future GitHub workflow integration inside the Product-Engineering OS.

## Analysis
Analyzing all repository sources for CI/CD Pipeline patterns...

## Production Rules
- Produce assets with complete lifecycle states, not partial notes.
- Preserve behavior unless a migration is named, justified, tested, and rollback-ready.
- Use typed interfaces for data, APIs, components, events, jobs, or docs.
- Where UI is involved, enforce Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Radix primitives, semantic tokens, accessible labels, focus states, responsive breakpoints, and loading/error/empty/success states.
- Where data or backend behavior is involved, enforce transactions, idempotency, validation, observability, retry semantics, and rollback strategy.
- Where QA is involved, convert requirements into executable checks and regression matrices.

## Error Handling
Cover validation failure, missing dependencies, unauthorized access, stale state, duplicate operations, timeouts, rate limits, partial writes, rollback failures, malformed external data, empty states, and user-visible recovery.

## Verification
Check references, schemas, prop contracts, accessibility, performance, regression coverage, and release readiness. A guide output is complete only if QA can verify it without private explanation.

<!-- ENHANCEMENT-PASS-2026-05-05-NON-REGRESSION -->

## Recursive Enhancement Pass - Non-Regression Layer

### Self-Challenge Result
Analyzing all repository sources for scripts patterns revealed that the existing Product-Engineering OS was structurally strong but could be deepened with newly discovered governance, editor-rule, changelog, coding-lesson, and framework-specific standards. This section augments the existing file without deleting or reducing any prior content.

### Newly Integrated Repository Paradigms
- Execution authority: treat clear user requests as execution instructions. Do not create permission loops for non-destructive governance, changelog, documentation, GitHub/Jira-supporting, or delivery-supporting artifacts when those actions are naturally implied.
- Mandatory confirmation boundary: ask before destructive deletion, irreversible overwrite, production deployment, external publishing, external messaging, security-sensitive changes, or access-control-sensitive work.
- Canonical read order: read governance/controller, execution authority rules, coding lessons, UI/UX rules when UI is affected, changelogs, latest versioning artifacts, the global OS controller, SYSTEM.md, and the local target instructions.
- Append-only knowledge: changelogs, coding lessons, build logs, governance history, and design/system decisions must be augmented rather than replaced. Never overwrite delivery history to make a clean narrative.
- Cursor/Continue integration: when .cursor, cursor/rules, .continue, or continue/rules are present, treat them as editor-enforced local governance. Mirror their standards into scripts/linting_rules.md and QA checks before changing generated assets.
- Prompt package discipline: prompt collections must include validated metadata such as name, description, type, slug, files, author, development process, categories, tags, tech stack, model, editor, and version. Slugs must be unique, hidden prompt-package files are invalid, and prompt packages should avoid nested structures unless explicitly supported.
- Framework standards: Next 15 and React 19 work should prefer App Router, Server Components by default, Client Components only for interaction, strict TypeScript, explicit props, route-level loading/error boundaries, Suspense where appropriate, minimal dependencies, and shadcn/ui components installed with the current 
px shadcn@latest add command.
- Design standards: preserve every working entrypoint, validate mobile and desktop layouts, prevent overflow and broken focus states, keep dropdowns readable, maintain usable CTAs/filters/dialogs/navigation, and make hierarchy follow business priority.
- Operational risk standards: compare at least two solution options when risk is non-trivial, choose the smallest regression-risk path, re-check previously working flows, update governance/changelog artifacts when naturally implied, and provide QA handoff.
- Changelog-derived lessons: use modular feature registries instead of single-purpose app shells, add SSRF/private-network guardrails for request tools, redact sensitive headers, cap timeouts, use cache: no-store when stale perception is harmful, and distinguish runtime-observed evidence from code-inferred evidence.
- Coding-lesson traps: align TypeScript interfaces with SQL columns, handle Supabase FK relation typing deliberately, prefer getUser() over trusting getSession() for auth-critical checks, avoid middleware redirect traps, avoid RLS policies that join across protected tables, validate provider-specific geospatial params, never mix bbox and point-radius casually, apply provider throttling/backoff, and avoid hard filters that zero out valid results.

### guide Application Rule
For this guide artifact, every future generated asset must explicitly state which newly discovered repository standards apply, which do not apply, and why. If a source class is absent in a future run, record that absence instead of silently assuming it does not matter.

## Scripts Rationalization And CI/CD Hardening Layer

Analyzing all repository sources for Scripts rationalization patterns... This file is the canonical CI/CD guide. The previous underscore alias `scripts/ci_cd_pipeline.md` is represented above by a lossless consolidation import and is archived under `scripts/archive/2026-05-10-rationalized/`.

Before executing this, ensure `scripts/README.md`, `scripts/linting-rules.md`, `scripts/reference-verification.md`, `qa-and-checks/checklist.md`, `qa-and-checks/security-checks.md`, and `qa-and-checks/performance-checks.md` are reviewed for compatibility.

External standards now enforced:
- GitHub Actions workflows must declare least-privilege `permissions`, avoid untrusted script injection, prefer pinned third-party actions or reviewed trusted sources, isolate secrets, and use environment protection for release jobs.
- CI must use explicit triggers, concurrency cancellation for superseded branch builds, deterministic dependency installation, build/test/lint/typecheck gates, artifact retention rules, and readable job names.
- Release automation must distinguish validation, staging deploy, production deploy, rollback, and post-deploy verification.
- Semantic Versioning impact must be named in release handoff: breaking, feature, patch, prerelease, or internal-only.
- No production-affecting workflow may run from generated guidance without a QA gate from `qa-and-checks/checklist.md`.
