# Linting Rules Hyphen Alias

<!-- MY-AI-DEV-SYSTEM-EXPANSION-2026-05-05 -->

## Mission
This file is part of the expanded my-ai-dev-system structure inside the Product-Engineering OS. It exists to turn repository knowledge into production-ready assets, not isolated snippets. The artifact augments previous architecture and must not reduce, delete, or contradict existing generated content.

## Analysis
Analyzing all repository sources for Linting Rules Hyphen Alias patterns...

Sources reviewed include the current OS files, AGENTS.md, AI_EXECUTION_PROMPTS.md, CLAUDE.md, LOCAL_EXECUTION_MODE.md, governance/*, continue/rules, cursor/rules, GitHub workflow guidance, Source/Changelogs, Source/Codinglessonslearnt, prompt metadata schemas, Next/shadcn/React/Tailwind prompt packs, UI/UX master prompts, and design master rules.

Extracted repository principles:
- Treat clear user requests as execution instructions and avoid repeated permission loops unless the action is destructive, external, production-affecting, security-sensitive, or genuinely ambiguous.
- Preserve already working behavior. Prefer the smallest regression-risk solution and re-check affected flows after every change.
- Use append-only knowledge management for changelogs, coding lessons, build logs, governance notes, and architectural decisions.
- Mine changelogs and coding lessons before work. Explicitly avoid repeated traps: interface/schema drift, Supabase FK typing surprises, auth/session misuse, middleware redirect traps, RLS cross-table joins, provider param errors, concurrency/rate-limit omissions, and overly strict filters that erase valid results.
- For UI and frontend work, enforce Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Radix-compatible primitives, semantic tokens, Headline/CTA/Grid hierarchy, visible focus states, mobile/desktop validation, readable dropdowns, complete loading/empty/error/success states, and no overflow.
- For Next 15 / React 19 work, prefer App Router, Server Components by default, Client Components only for interactivity, explicit TypeScript props, route loading/error boundaries, Suspense when appropriate, minimal dependencies, and 
px shadcn@latest add.
- For prompt packages, require metadata validation, unique slugs, no hidden prompt-package files, no unsupported nested prompt structures, and .md, .mdc, or iprompt.json only when following the source prompt catalog rules.

## Persona
Act as a senior Scripts owner with 15+ years of production experience. You are accountable for business behavior, technical correctness, accessibility, security, performance, observability, and QA handoff.

## Purpose
Create hyphenated linting alias matching my-ai-dev-system map while preserving existing underscore guide.

## Operating Rules
- Read i_dev_system.md, SYSTEM.md, docs/repository_source_inventory.md, and the local domain instruction before execution.
- Before executing this, ensure scripts/linting-rules.md; .ai/best-practices.md is reviewed for compatibility.
- Do not erase prior decisions. If a new rule supersedes an older one, append a migration note and compatibility rationale.
- Keep business intent visible: define user problem, expected behavior, scope, non-goals, validation, and rollout impact.
- Include at least happy path, empty state, error state, permission failure, timeout/retry behavior, and rollback or recovery handling.
- When user-facing, provide React props, keyboard behavior, ARIA labels, responsive breakpoints, focus states, and loading/empty/error/success copy.
- When server-facing, provide API envelope, error taxonomy, idempotency, logging, redaction, rate limits, timeout caps, and observability fields.
- When data-facing, provide schema invariants, FK/index rules, migration/backfill strategy, rollback strategy, seed-data behavior, and query performance checks.

## Supadupa Enhancement Layer

### Analysis
Analyzing all repository sources for Linting Rules supadupa-enhancement patterns...

This enhancement layer deepens the existing Scripts artifact with the newest repository-wide operating memory. It preserves all prior content and adds stronger instructions for source ingestion, append-only governance, production-ready asset generation, and QA-verifiable delivery.

### Added Capability
Adds reference verification and prompt metadata validation requirements.

### Mandatory Source Patterns To Apply
- Read governance and execution authority before implementation when present.
- Treat clear requests as execution instructions; avoid extra permission loops for non-destructive implied work.
- Ask before destructive deletion, irreversible overwrite, production deployment, external publishing, external messages, security-sensitive operations, or access-control-sensitive operations.
- Mine changelogs and coding lessons before changing templates or production assets.
- Preserve working behavior; compare at least two solution options when risk is non-trivial.
- Keep changelogs, build logs, lessons, and architectural notes append-only.
- Enforce Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Radix, Headline/CTA/Grid hierarchy, responsive breakpoints, focus states, and loading/empty/error/success states for user-facing assets.
- Require JSON schemas, React props, API envelopes, data invariants, and QA handoff where relevant.

## Formatter And Static Quality Migration Layer

Analyzing all repository sources for linting and formatter patterns... Static quality must be a governance system, not only style cleanup. Projects may use ESLint, Prettier, Biome, TypeScript checks, Markdown link checks, PowerShell analysis, JSON schema validation, or equivalent tools, but the active stack must be explicit and CI-blocking for the risks it owns.

Required migration rules:
- If migrating from ESLint/Prettier to Biome or adding Biome beside existing tools, document the overlap, rule ownership, formatter ownership, ignored files, staged adoption plan, and rollback path.
- CI scripts must expose separate check and fix commands where supported, such as `check`, `fix`, `format`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, and prompt metadata validation. Auto-fix must not run silently in production verification.
- Staged/pre-commit checks may be fast subsets, but CI must run the authoritative full check set for changed domains.
- Prompt packages must be linted for metadata shape, allowed file extensions, slug uniqueness, hidden files, unsupported nested directories, stale archived references, and missing build-log entries.
- TypeScript/TSX parser checks must run after frontend edits. Import existence and icon-library import availability must be checked when generated assets add new files or icons.
- PowerShell file operations must use literal paths, avoid cross-shell destructive composition, and require dry-run or confirmation semantics for destructive routines.

Static quality contract:
```json
{
  "static_quality_stack": {
    "formatter_owner": "prettier | biome | project-equivalent",
    "linter_owner": "eslint | biome | framework | project-equivalent",
    "typescript_check": true,
    "markdown_reference_check": true,
    "prompt_metadata_check": true,
    "powershell_safety_check": true,
    "ci_blocking": true,
    "autofix_separated_from_check": true
  }
}
```

Compatibility cross-links: before changing static checks, review `ci-cd-pipeline.md`, `prompt-metadata-validation.md`, `reference-verification.md`, `../frontend/tests.md`, `../qa-and-checks/checklist.md`, and `../.ai/best-practices.md`.
Before executing this enhancement, ensure scripts/reference-verification.md; scripts/prompt-metadata-validation.md are reviewed for compatibility.

## Lossless Consolidation Import From `AI_PROMPTING_FOLDERSTRUCTURE/scripts/linting_rules.md`

This section preserves unique and potentially unique source content during the 2026-05-08 folder-by-folder consolidation pass. It was imported append-only so no instruction, edge case, example, table row, code block, warning, implementation note, or nuance is lost. Exact duplication can be removed only after a section-by-section proof confirms no unique meaning remains.

# Linting Rules

## Purpose
This guide defines production-grade rules for static checks, prompt hygiene, Tailwind/shadcn/ui/Radix guardrails, and future .cursor/.continue standards inside the Product-Engineering OS.

## Production Rules
- Produce assets with complete lifecycle states, not partial notes.
- Preserve behavior unless a migration is named, justified, tested, and rollback-ready.
- Use typed interfaces for data, APIs, components, events, jobs, or docs.
- Where UI is involved, enforce Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Radix primitives, semantic tokens, accessible labels, focus states, responsive breakpoints, and loading/error/empty/success states.
- Where data or backend behavior is involved, enforce transactions, idempotency, validation, observability, retry semantics, and rollback strategy.
- Where QA is involved, convert requirements into executable checks and regression matrices.

## Error Handling
Cover validation failure, missing dependencies, unauthorized access, stale state, duplicate operations, timeouts, rate limits, partial writes, rollback failures, malformed external data, empty states, and user-visible recovery.

## Verification
Check references, schemas, prop contracts, accessibility, performance, regression coverage, and release readiness. A guide output is complete only if QA can verify it without private explanation.

<!-- ENHANCEMENT-PASS-2026-05-05-NON-REGRESSION -->

## Recursive Enhancement Pass - Non-Regression Layer

### Self-Challenge Result
Analyzing all repository sources for scripts patterns revealed that the existing Product-Engineering OS was structurally strong but could be deepened with newly discovered governance, editor-rule, changelog, coding-lesson, and framework-specific standards. This section augments the existing file without deleting or reducing any prior content.

### Newly Integrated Repository Paradigms
- Execution authority: treat clear user requests as execution instructions. Do not create permission loops for non-destructive governance, changelog, documentation, GitHub/Jira-supporting, or delivery-supporting artifacts when those actions are naturally implied.
- Mandatory confirmation boundary: ask before destructive deletion, irreversible overwrite, production deployment, external publishing, external messaging, security-sensitive changes, or access-control-sensitive work.
- Canonical read order: read governance/controller, execution authority rules, coding lessons, UI/UX rules when UI is affected, changelogs, latest versioning artifacts, the global OS controller, SYSTEM.md, and the local target instructions.
- Append-only knowledge: changelogs, coding lessons, build logs, governance history, and design/system decisions must be augmented rather than replaced. Never overwrite delivery history to make a clean narrative.
- Cursor/Continue integration: when .cursor, cursor/rules, .continue, or continue/rules are present, treat them as editor-enforced local governance. Mirror their standards into scripts/linting_rules.md and QA checks before changing generated assets.
- Prompt package discipline: prompt collections must include validated metadata such as name, description, type, slug, files, author, development process, categories, tags, tech stack, model, editor, and version. Slugs must be unique, hidden prompt-package files are invalid, and prompt packages should avoid nested structures unless explicitly supported.
- Framework standards: Next 15 and React 19 work should prefer App Router, Server Components by default, Client Components only for interaction, strict TypeScript, explicit props, route-level loading/error boundaries, Suspense where appropriate, minimal dependencies, and shadcn/ui components installed with the current 
px shadcn@latest add command.
- Design standards: preserve every working entrypoint, validate mobile and desktop layouts, prevent overflow and broken focus states, keep dropdowns readable, maintain usable CTAs/filters/dialogs/navigation, and make hierarchy follow business priority.
- Operational risk standards: compare at least two solution options when risk is non-trivial, choose the smallest regression-risk path, re-check previously working flows, update governance/changelog artifacts when naturally implied, and provide QA handoff.
- Changelog-derived lessons: use modular feature registries instead of single-purpose app shells, add SSRF/private-network guardrails for request tools, redact sensitive headers, cap timeouts, use cache: no-store when stale perception is harmful, and distinguish runtime-observed evidence from code-inferred evidence.
- Coding-lesson traps: align TypeScript interfaces with SQL columns, handle Supabase FK relation typing deliberately, prefer getUser() over trusting getSession() for auth-critical checks, avoid middleware redirect traps, avoid RLS policies that join across protected tables, validate provider-specific geospatial params, never mix bbox and point-radius casually, apply provider throttling/backoff, and avoid hard filters that zero out valid results.

### guide Application Rule
For this guide artifact, every future generated asset must explicitly state which newly discovered repository standards apply, which do not apply, and why. If a source class is absent in a future run, record that absence instead of silently assuming it does not matter.

## Scripts Rationalization And Linting Hardening Layer

Analyzing all repository sources for Scripts rationalization patterns... This file is the canonical linting and static-verification guide. The previous underscore alias `scripts/linting_rules.md` is represented above by a lossless consolidation import and is archived under `scripts/archive/2026-05-10-rationalized/`.

Before executing this, ensure `scripts/README.md`, `scripts/reference-verification.md`, `scripts/prompt-metadata-validation.md`, `qa-and-checks/checklist.md`, `frontend/tests.md`, and `.ai/best-practices.md` are reviewed for compatibility.

External standards now enforced:
- ESLint flat configuration should be treated as a versioned quality contract. Lint rules must cover correctness, unsafe patterns, accessibility where relevant, import boundaries, unused code, and TypeScript strictness.
- Prettier configuration should be centralized so formatting does not become an implicit local-editor choice.
- PowerShell scripts should be checked with PSScriptAnalyzer-style rules and should document destructive behavior with confirmation or dry-run expectations.
- Static checks must verify canonical hyphenated filenames, archived alias handling, broken references, duplicate prompt slugs, hidden prompt-package files, placeholder leakage, and stale references to archived files.
- Linting must not become cosmetic-only. It should protect contracts, security, accessibility, performance, and repository governance.

Required linting output contract:
