# Frontend Tests

<!-- MY-AI-DEV-SYSTEM-EXPANSION-2026-05-05 -->

## Mission
This file is part of the expanded my-ai-dev-system structure inside the Product-Engineering OS. It exists to turn repository knowledge into production-ready assets, not isolated snippets. The artifact augments previous architecture and must not reduce, delete, or contradict existing generated content.

## Analysis
Analyzing all repository sources for Frontend Tests patterns...

Sources reviewed include the current OS files, AGENTS.md, AI_EXECUTION_PROMPTS.md, CLAUDE.md, LOCAL_EXECUTION_MODE.md, governance/*, continue/rules, cursor/rules, GitHub workflow guidance, Source/Changelogs, Source/Codinglessonslearnt, prompt metadata schemas, Next/shadcn/React/Tailwind prompt packs, UI/UX master prompts, and design master rules.

Extracted repository principles:
- Treat clear user requests as execution instructions and avoid repeated permission loops unless the action is destructive, external, production-affecting, security-sensitive, or genuinely ambiguous.
- Preserve already working behavior. Prefer the smallest regression-risk solution and re-check affected flows after every change.
- Use append-only knowledge management for changelogs, coding lessons, build logs, governance notes, and architectural decisions.
- Mine changelogs and coding lessons before work. Explicitly avoid repeated traps: interface/schema drift, Supabase FK typing surprises, auth/session misuse, middleware redirect traps, RLS cross-table joins, provider param errors, concurrency/rate-limit omissions, and overly strict filters that erase valid results.
- For UI and frontend work, enforce Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Radix-compatible primitives, semantic tokens, Headline/CTA/Grid hierarchy, visible focus states, mobile/desktop validation, readable dropdowns, complete loading/empty/error/success states, and no overflow.
- For Next 15 / React 19 work, prefer App Router, Server Components by default, Client Components only for interactivity, explicit TypeScript props, route loading/error boundaries, Suspense when appropriate, minimal dependencies, and 
px shadcn@latest add.
- For prompt packages, require metadata validation, unique slugs, no hidden prompt-package files, no unsupported nested prompt structures, and .md, .mdc, or iprompt.json only when following the source prompt catalog rules.

## Operating Rules
- Read i_dev_system.md, SYSTEM.md, docs/repository_source_inventory.md, and the local domain instruction before execution.
- Before executing this, ensure frontend/frontend-system.md; qa-and-checks/checklist.md is reviewed for compatibility.
- Do not erase prior decisions. If a new rule supersedes an older one, append a migration note and compatibility rationale.
- Keep business intent visible: define user problem, expected behavior, scope, non-goals, validation, and rollout impact.
- Include at least happy path, empty state, error state, permission failure, timeout/retry behavior, and rollback or recovery handling.
- When user-facing, provide React props, keyboard behavior, ARIA labels, responsive breakpoints, focus states, and loading/empty/error/success copy.
- When server-facing, provide API envelope, error taxonomy, idempotency, logging, redaction, rate limits, timeout caps, and observability fields.
- When data-facing, provide schema invariants, FK/index rules, migration/backfill strategy, rollback strategy, seed-data behavior, and query performance checks.

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All repository sources were scanned or the inventory was refreshed.

## 2026-05-09 Internet-Tuned Rationalization Layer

### Analysis
Analyzing all repository sources for frontend rationalization patterns, then upgrading the canonical frontend prompt surface with current external documentation from React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix Primitives, WCAG 2.2, and web.dev Core Web Vitals.

### Current Source Anchors
- Next.js App Router docs list 16.2.2 as the current docs latest version and expose App Router primitives for project structure, layouts/pages, linking/navigation, server/client components, fetching data, caching, error handling, testing, and production checks.
- Next.js production guidance says Server Components are default, Client Components should be used as needed for interactivity, route segments enable code splitting, and streaming with Loading UI plus React Suspense prevents entire routes from blocking on data.
- React Server Components guidance requires Client Components for interactivity through the `use client` boundary; avoid spreading that boundary higher than needed because it increases client JavaScript.
- React Server Functions guidance treats all client-passed arguments as untrusted input, requires authorization for mutations, and positions Server Functions primarily for state-changing mutations rather than general data fetching.
- Tailwind CSS v4 exposes design tokens as native CSS variables and supports a CSS-first theme model; frontend prompts must connect this to `../ui/tokens.md` instead of inventing token scales.
- shadcn/ui Tailwind v4 guidance supports React 19 and Tailwind v4, updates primitives with `data-slot`, prefers `sonner` over deprecated toast usage, and modernizes new projects toward `new-york` and OKLCH tokens.
- Radix Primitives follow WAI-ARIA authoring practices and include keyboard support patterns; prompts must still require labels, roles, focus behavior, and QA checks rather than assuming primitives alone guarantee accessibility.
- WCAG 2.2 adds focus-not-obscured, focus appearance, dragging alternatives, target size minimum, and accessible authentication criteria that must be reflected in frontend acceptance tests.
- web.dev Core Web Vitals remain LCP, INP, and CLS; target LCP at 2.5s or less, INP at 200ms or less, and CLS at 0.1 or less for user-facing frontend work.

### Rationalized Frontend Rules
- Keep Server Components as the default for data-heavy, non-interactive UI; introduce Client Components only at the smallest interactive leaf.
- Do not reference `window`, `document`, browser storage, effects, or event handlers in Server Components.
- Use route-level `loading`, `error`, `not-found`, and layout boundaries deliberately; every route prompt must specify loading, empty, error, auth, permission, retry, and recovery states.
- Use Server Functions for mutations only after validation, authorization, CSRF/session considerations, and typed success/error envelopes are defined.
- Keep state ownership explicit: server/cache state, URL/search-param state, local UI state, form state, optimistic state, and persisted preference state must not be blurred together.
- Use Tailwind v4 theme variables and local UI tokens as the source of truth; no new color, radius, shadow, or spacing scale may be invented without linking to `../ui/tokens.md`.
- Prefer shadcn/ui and Radix-compatible primitives for complex accessible components, but still define keyboard paths, accessible names, focus visibility, escape/close behavior, and screen-reader states.
- Performance acceptance must name bundle risk, client-boundary risk, image/font/script handling, streaming strategy, and Core Web Vitals impact.
- Every generated frontend asset must provide JSON schema, React props or TypeScript interfaces, state matrix, responsive behavior, accessibility checks, error handling, QA handoff, and rollback/non-regression notes.

### Compatibility Gate
Before executing this rationalized frontend guidance, review `README.md`, `ai_instructions.md`, `frontend-system.md`, the task-specific frontend file, `../ui/tokens.md`, `../ui/accessibility.md`, `../ux/states.md`, `../integration/api-contracts.md`, and `../qa-and-checks/checklist.md`.

## Coding Lessons Ingestion - Frontend Build Safety

Source reviewed: `C:/Users/Lenovo/Downloads/codingLessonsLearnt (2).md`.

New frontend test lessons to enforce:
- Patch-only packages must include every newly introduced supporting file. Before handoff, enumerate changed imports and prove every new `@/...` target exists and is included in the delivery set.
- For Next.js App Router, file names are contracts. Verify `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, and route segment placement before calling a route complete.
- If full build is not feasible, run at least parser/syntax/type-oriented checks on every modified TS/TSX file. Large UI redesigns are not allowed to ship as unparsed text.
- Verify Lucide icon imports against the installed version or a known-safe whitelist before delivering a redesign patch. Replace uncertain icons with stable alternatives rather than discovering missing exports at build time.
- Run hook-order smoke checks for components touched near early returns, conditional rendering, and route switching.
