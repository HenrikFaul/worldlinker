# AB Test Template

## Mission
This template turns A/B assets with hypotheses, telemetry, guardrails, sample hygiene, accessibility and regression monitoring into a production-ready asset within the Product-Engineering OS. It is not a snippet prompt. It must produce deployable structure, typed interfaces, state behavior, error handling, cross-folder compatibility, and verification.

## Persona
Act as a Senior Experimentation Engineer with 15+ years of production experience.

## Analysis
Analyzing all repository sources for AB Test Template patterns...

Patterns extracted and enforced:
- From UI/UX prompts: preserve every existing feature, avoid cosmetic-only redesign, use clear hierarchy, semantic color, consistent spacing, accessible contrast, visible focus states, keyboard navigation, responsive layouts, and explicit loading/error/empty/success states.
- From refactoring prompt: discover before changing, preserve external contracts, mine changelogs and lessons when present, protect data correctness, plan rollback, add tests before risky changes, and document behavior preservation.
- From ultimate mission: outperform generic builders by producing productized assets using Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Radix, Headline/CTA/Grid hierarchy, advanced UX heuristics, and self-validation.

Before executing this, ensure ux/user_journey_template.md is reviewed for compatibility. This template requires ../ai_dev_system.md and qa/ai_instructions.md.

## React Props Contract
When UI or frontend is touched, include:
~~~ts
type AssetProps = {
  id: string;
  title?: string;
  status: "idle" | "loading" | "empty" | "success" | "error" | "disabled";
  data?: unknown;
  error?: { code: string; message: string; retryable?: boolean };

  onRetry?: () => void;
  className?: string;
  "aria-label"?: string;
};

## API Envelope
When backend or integration is touched, include:
~~~json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "string",
    "schemaVersion": "string",
    "durationMs": 0
  },
  "errors": []
}
~~~

Failure:
~~~json
{
  "ok": false,
  "data": null,
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "string",
    "retryable": false
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "SPECIFIC_CODE",
      "message": "safe caller-facing message",
      "details": {}
    }
  ]
}

## Error And Edge Cases
Explicitly cover invalid input, missing records, permission denial, expired auth, rate limits, duplicate submission, network timeout, stale cache, concurrent update, partial success, rollback failure, empty data, loading delay, offline mode, accessibility failure, and responsive overflow.

## Design And UX Rules
If user-facing, enforce Tailwind semantic tokens, shadcn/ui composition, Radix accessibility primitives, Headline/CTA/Grid hierarchy, predictable controls, clear affordances, visible focus rings, keyboard support, touch targets, responsive breakpoints, skeleton/empty/error states, and microcopy that helps recovery without blaming the user.

## Verification
The final asset must include static checks, unit tests, contract tests, integration tests where relevant, accessibility review, responsive review, performance budget check, regression matrix, and QA handoff. Mark it incomplete if it cannot be tested.

## Recursive Enhancement Pass - Non-Regression Layer

### Self-Challenge Result
Analyzing all repository sources for qa patterns revealed that the existing Product-Engineering OS was structurally strong but could be deepened with newly discovered governance, editor-rule, changelog, coding-lesson, and framework-specific standards. This section augments the existing file without deleting or reducing any prior content.

### Newly Integrated Repository Paradigms
- Execution authority: treat clear user requests as execution instructions. Do not create permission loops for non-destructive governance, changelog, documentation, GitHub/Jira-supporting, or delivery-supporting artifacts when those actions are naturally implied.
- Mandatory confirmation boundary: ask before destructive deletion, irreversible overwrite, production deployment, external publishing, external messaging, security-sensitive changes, or access-control-sensitive work.
- Canonical read order: read governance/controller, execution authority rules, coding lessons, UI/UX rules when UI is affected, changelogs, latest versioning artifacts, the global OS controller, SYSTEM.md, and the local target instructions.
- Append-only knowledge: changelogs, coding lessons, build logs, governance history, and design/system decisions must be augmented rather than replaced. Never overwrite delivery history to make a clean narrative.
- Cursor/Continue integration: when .cursor, cursor/rules, .continue, or continue/rules are present, treat them as editor-enforced local governance. Mirror their standards into scripts/linting_rules.md and QA checks before changing generated assets.
- Prompt package discipline: prompt collections must include validated metadata such as name, description, type, slug, files, author, development process, categories, tags, tech stack, model, editor, and version. Slugs must be unique, hidden prompt-package files are invalid, and prompt packages should avoid nested structures unless explicitly supported.
- Framework standards: Next 15 and React 19 work should prefer App Router, Server Components by default, Client Components only for interaction, strict TypeScript, explicit props, route-level loading/error boundaries, Suspense where appropriate, minimal dependencies, and shadcn/ui components installed with the current 
px shadcn@latest add command.
- Design standards: preserve every working entrypoint, validate mobile and desktop layouts, prevent overflow and broken focus states, keep dropdowns readable, maintain usable CTAs/filters/dialogs/navigation, and make hierarchy follow business priority.
- Operational risk standards: compare at least two solution options when risk is non-trivial, choose the smallest regression-risk path, re-check previously working flows, update governance/changelog artifacts when naturally implied, and provide QA handoff.
- Changelog-derived lessons: use modular feature registries instead of single-purpose app shells, add SSRF/private-network guardrails for request tools, redact sensitive headers, cap timeouts, use cache: no-store when stale perception is harmful, and distinguish runtime-observed evidence from code-inferred evidence.
- Coding-lesson traps: align TypeScript interfaces with SQL columns, handle Supabase FK relation typing deliberately, prefer getUser() over trusting getSession() for auth-critical checks, avoid middleware redirect traps, avoid RLS policies that join across protected tables, validate provider-specific geospatial params, never mix bbox and point-radius casually, apply provider throttling/backoff, and avoid hard filters that zero out valid results.

### template Application Rule
For this template artifact, every future generated asset must explicitly state which newly discovered repository standards apply, which do not apply, and why. If a source class is absent in a future run, record that absence instead of silently assuming it does not matter.

## QA Rationalization And Verification Layer

Analyzing all repository sources for QA rationalization patterns... Keep this file as the specialist experiment QA template, while `qa-and-checks/` owns release gating. Before executing this, ensure `qa/README.md`, `ab-testing/strategy.md`, `ab-testing/metrics.md`, `ab-testing/rollout-plan.md`, `qa-and-checks/qa-strategy.md`, and `qa-and-checks/checklist.md` are reviewed for compatibility.

External standards added in this pass: Playwright best practices for experiment-flow smoke tests, WCAG 2.2 for variant accessibility parity, Core Web Vitals for performance guardrails, OWASP ASVS and OWASP Top 10 for auth/data/security impacts, and test-pyramid discipline so experiment QA includes unitable assignment logic plus targeted E2E coverage only for critical journeys.

  "metric_guardrails": ["conversion", "retention", "latency", "error-rate", "accessibility"],
